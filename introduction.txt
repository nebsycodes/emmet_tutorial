Hi I'm James!

This lesson is designed for people that already have some base knowledge of HTML. This is assuming they know different
elements in HTML, such as print, list, and divs.

What is emmet?
Emmet is an in built function for Visual Studio Code using abbreviations. It can be used for a wide range of 
programming languages. Created by Vadim Makeev in 2008. 

Why is emmet used?
For speed and efficiency when coding, it reduces the need for repetitive typing. This is all about working smarter, not harder.

We will go through 5 steps for this lesson:
- The basics of shortcutting our code with a html template, 
- Delve deeper into how we can use more shortcuts, 
- Create multiple shortcuts together to see how far it can go.

First of all i would like you all to follow along and create a file for each step.
so then you can have this as your own resource to refer to.

We'll review all these steps at the end of the lesson.
