What is emmett?
Emmett is an in built function for Visual Studio Code using abreviations. It can be used for a wide range of 
programming languages.

Why is emmett used?
For speed and efficiency when coding, it reduces the need for repetitive typing.

What we will go through:
We'll work through the basics of shorcutting our code with a html template, 
then we'll delve deeper into how we can use shorcuts, 
then we'll create multiple shortcuts together to see how far it can go.

First of all i would like you all to follow along and create a file for each step.
so then you can have this as your own resource to refer to.
