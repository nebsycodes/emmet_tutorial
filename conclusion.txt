So now you can see how fast we can write 40+ lines of code within a second.
I hope you find this as a helpful tool that can be used to speed up your code

these are the ones we have learned:
    ! - for our html template
    crtl / - to comment out a line quick
    x*5 - to create multiple elements
    x+y - place elements near each other, on the same level.
    x>y - nest elements inside each other.

I discovered emmet through my further learning and I
find it very useful for my programming, so I wanted to share this with you all.

Now you can experiment with new combonations.
