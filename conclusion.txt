I hope you find this as a helpful tool that can be used to speed up your code

these are the ones we have learned:
! - for our html template
crtl / - to comment out a line
div*5 - to create multiple elements
li+p - place elements near each other, on the same level.
li>p - nest elements inside each other.

Any questions?
