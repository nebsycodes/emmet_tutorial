crtl / - to comment out a line
x*5 - to create multiple elements
x+y - place elements near each other, on the same level.
x>y - nest elements inside each other.

you can check out this cheat sheet: https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/

I have found emmett from my further learning and I 
find it very useful for my programming, so I wanted to share this with you all.
